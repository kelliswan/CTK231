      <p class="special">My music has created healing and change I have needed and it has given me a purpose. 

Music and healing is the mission. 

I just want to create beauty from my ashes. 

 

Hebrews 11:1“Faith is the substance hoped for and the evidence of what is unseen.” 

Faith has been a growing concept, theme, feeling and belief in 2021. I have decided to have faith and keep praying for my faith to increase and for the faith of others to increase. I found that it meant faith in God and faith as a power in life to move mountains and manifest and attract things. 

God makes the impossible - possible.God makes the invisible - visible. God makes the bad things good.God makes the undoable - doable God has caused me to see a new reality. 

I decided to take the jump and take the world by the horns and create the reality that I have seen in my mind and that I desire. I have written so much music and continue to spill more. Projects are ready to be recorded and released. I’ve started building a brand and music career and entrepreneurship. I’ve decided I don’t want to live the life I’ve been living in the reality that I did not design for myself. I decided from now on that I would use my being and all my creativity to create change and impact and beauty and my reality. I am a deep well of many things and I am ready now to manifest it into reality to build my life into what I’ve envisioned. 

Because I am an artist in many ways and especially in music - I know that I have a platform to use my voice. I want to speak for others like me who have suffered or are still suffering with mental illness and suicidal ideation. I want to speak for women and children, the unfortunate and those that are not heard or are silenced. I want to be an advocate and an influence for better things and better ways. I know the darkness of the mind from my own experiences. I’ve been lower than rock bottom. I’ve lost my mind entirely at one point in my life. I couldn’t gather my thoughts or think straight or have a grasp on who I was or what I felt or knew or remembered. I literally have gone beyond. I am not afraid to share that I have had horrifying suffering at the hands of my mind and emotions. My own body has betrayed me over and over. I know the pain. I know trauma. I know darkness. I know evil. I also know light. I know God and I know Jesus and I understand the depth of Gods love. I understand that there is a creator that created love and relentlessly and unconditionally loves us just as we are. The Bible says“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.”1 Corinthians 13:4-5 

I still can’t wrap my mind around the true concept of love and how that’s what it is and what it means and how it behaves. I never saw love this way or ever understood characteristics of it. I have been in my own hell on earth and on my own opposite path born of the rebel in me.I can tell you the very depths of horror and sadness and pain to the heights of euphoria. God is the only thing that goes with you thru it all. You can choose any religion on earth and nobody is stopping you. All I’m saying is , in my searching and suffering and longing I found God was there the whole time. Prayers have been answered. Miracles have happened. I’m still alive and I can assure you I really really really didn’t want to be alive. God proved to me that things can change and he showed himself to me over and over. I came to a point that I didn’t care if I went to heaven or hell because the suffering in my life was enough of a hell for me that out was out so nothing matters. God kept chasing me. God never gave up on me. No matter how many times I cussed him out or told him I hate him and that he doesn’t love me or care or do anything in my life and I blamed him for everything in my life. I discovered that God is actually not a bully at all like I felt he was.I still saw the supernatural things. Tapped into spirits and different states and did tarot and talked to psychics and witches. I have seen demons for longer than I can remember and I promise you - the only thing in sleep paralysis that you can do - when you’re staring at a giant big black shadow dementor looking demon - say Jesus. Instead of feeling my soul leave my body over and over and over and feeling drugged and vibrations that make your body feel overwhelmingly weird and the absolute terror feeling that makes you want to jump out of your body and run away - I started saying Jesus over and over and it would stop. I started playing God music like my gospel favs all night and Bible scripture reading all night and the demons stopped coming. God showed me love over and over and showed me love thru people and reading the Bible has shown me really what it all is conceptually. God gives a damn and actually does do things and show himself if you pull a me and ask him who he is and to prove himself to you so you could believe. At this point I just want to share my story and show that it’s possible not only to get up from rockbottom over and over but to grow and get better and better NO MATTER HOW BAD things have been. It’s possible to rebuild. It’s possible to renew. It’s possible to create something out of nothing and to create something out of negative things and suffering. Suffering can be used for a greater purpose. Ashes can become beauty. 

I am ready to share the beauty of my ashes.
