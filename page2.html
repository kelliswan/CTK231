    <p><b>The eyes are the window to the soul. We may be deceived by our eyes at times while at other times our eyes enlighten us. We have to protect our eyes. As stated - to protect the eyes use goggles. This is not only a physical application of protection but can also be seen as a metaphor to express using goggles as another way to see while protecting the eyes at the same time.</b></p>
